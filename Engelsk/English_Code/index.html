            <p>One should always know some basics about where one's going when traveling anywhere, and the Philippines is no exception. Here are 8 basic points:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Manila is the capital city of the Philippines, located in Luzon, the largest island region.</li>
                <li>Luzon, together with Visayas and Mindanao, are the three main Filipino island regions.</li>
                <li>Even though English can easily be used in the Philippines, most people would probably speak in their own tongue, Filipino, the most used dialekt being Tagalog.</li>
                <li>The currency used there is the Filipino Peso (The safest option is searching Google).</li>
                <li>With a mix of a hot and humid climate, you should expect to sweat, so better pack light and airy clothes! One nice thing you can do is putt a towel on your back in your t-shirt, this will not only collect some of the sweat, but you can also save space for other things while drying yourself! Thanks mom! </li>
                <li>Mosquitos and other bugs and creepy crawlys lurk around every corner, just so you know ;)</li>
                <li>The sun is mighty and powerful, so sunscreen is recommended!</li>
                <li>Taking both points above to account, bug and sunscreen are readily available in the Philippines for purchasing if you forget to bring your own.</li>
