            <p>One must always remember: Food is a necessity for everyone! And the food available depends on the country and culture, and the Philippines is no exception. Just as anywhere else, the Filipino food is different, and delicious in it's own way! It's also a huge part of it's culture. Thats why we'll be taking a look at some amazing dishes and foods found in the Philippines!</p>
            
            <h2>Proper meals</h2>
            <p>These consists of something you would eat for defeating hunger on a normal basis. Like your breakfasts, lunches and dinners. Usually salt food. Keep in mind that mode of preparation depends on the chef.</p>

            <h3>Rice</h3>
            <p>Altough the rice is always used alongside something else, rice is just that important that it has to be mentioned. Basically everyone who is either in the Philippines, is Filipino, or Asian in general, eat rice all the time. Something I have heard once goes as follows: Rice is Life. Take this from someone who is Filipino themselves, It's true.</p>
